# My Favorite Fonts
I hand-picked some of the most readable, and nice fonts that I can use beside `Menlo`.

The code sample is from my [playground_ligo](https://github.com/thetrung/playground-ligo).


### `1. Input Mono Narrow`
Spacing medium, sharp text, medium height, narrow setting.

### `2. Input Sans`
More spacing, sharp & longer text, a balance experience.

### `3. JetBrains Mono`
The default font of the famous JetBrains IDE, 
you have rounder characters and balanced space/height.

### `4. JetBrains Mono NL`
Same but without merging `-` and `>` and some special characters keep original.

### `8. Source Code Pro`
